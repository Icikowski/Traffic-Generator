| `-success` | Desired success ratio in percents | no | integer from range `1` - `100` | `90` |
| `-requests` | Number of simultaneous requests to be sent in given interval | no | positive integer | `30` |
| `-interval` | Requests interval | no | duration | `2s` |
| `-timeout` | Requests timeout | no | duration (â‰¤ interval) | `1s` |
| `-insecure` | Insecure mode (SSL certificates of the target will not be verified) | no | just the presence of the flag which equals `true` | `false` |
